## Which problem do we want to solve? Where does it occur and who is affected by it?

We aim to make it easier for developers and entrepreneurs to validate their ideas with a ready-to-use, dependency-free UI library designed for building simple landing pages with email list signups.

The problem usually occurs when developers or entrepreneurs want to validate their ideas. For this developers usually opt for popular JavaScript-Frameworks and are stuck in the dependency hell immediately. Even modern UI libraries like Shadcn UI have dependencies that are difficult to trace.

This mainly affects developers and entrepreneurs who bootstrap their projects.

## How do I solve this problem?

The solution to this problem are ready-to-use, dependency-free UI library for simple landing pages and email signups. Vona needs to be installed fast e.g. using a CDN or copy-and-paste. Vona will follows Tailwind CSS syntax. This makes it possible to migrate from Vona to Tailwind CSS later.

## Why are the maintainers the right people to solve this problem?

We are the right people, because we deeply want to develop things that are simple, secure and lightweight. We care about dependencies and reduce them whenever possible. We have multiple years of experience in building websites using Go, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript without relying on JavaScript frameworks. Additionally, we developed Next.js apps using Tailwind CSS, so we know what dependency hell means.

## What we expect to happen

At the beginning we expect that fewer people are interested because JavaScrupt frameworks domintate the internet. But we deeply know, considering security and performance, that Vona will outperform any other UI library especially for setting up a landing page.

If we even look further, we know that less dependencies means simplicity and better maintainability and more focus on what matters: The business logic. If we see adoption through the space there will be no way that Vona won't be used for big software products because of the simplicity and maintainability.

Looking into the AI future, we also see that a dependency free UI library like Vona is easier to use for LLMs than a library that has long dependency trees.
